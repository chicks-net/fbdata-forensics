Given all of the recent issues around Facebook and the data it keeps about all of
us it seemed time for a tool to help us analyze the data dump Facebook is willing
to give us.

## Status

Working:

* search timeline for keywords
* read messages into sqlite database
* search database for keywords

Expected someday:

* print out all messages with one person
* note relationships of people

Maybe:

* parse other files
