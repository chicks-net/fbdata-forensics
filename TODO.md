# `fbdata-forensics` TODO's

## Expected someday:

I may already be working on these items so please open 
[a github issue](https://github.com/chicks-net/fbdata-forensics/issues)
before coding on these.

* log file to track invocations and results
* print out all messages with one person
* note relationships of people

## Maybe, maybe not:

I will consider pull requests for these features without prior discussion.

* feature comparison versus other FLOSS tools
* sample data (in JSON format) for QA tests and tutorials
* any [Kwalitee](https://qa.perl.org/phalanx/kwalitee.html) improvements
* parse other files (but now with JSON this task has shrunk considerably)
