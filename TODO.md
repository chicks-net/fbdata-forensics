# `fbdata-forensics` TODO's

## Expected someday:

I may already be working on these items so please open 
[a github issue](https://github.com/chicks-net/fbdata-forensics/issues)
before coding on these.

* write Using section of README
* print out all messages with one person
* note relationships of people

## Maybe, maybe not:

I will consider decent pull requests for these features.

* parse other files
* feature comparison versus othe other FLOSS tools
* sample data (in JSON format) for QA tests and tutorials
* any [Kwalitee](https://qa.perl.org/phalanx/kwalitee.html) improvements
