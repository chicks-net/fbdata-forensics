# fbdata-forensics `html_v0.1`

This code was built when Facebook only gave out HTML-formatted versions of
the data they have on us.  Now that the JSON version is available and is so
much easier to deal with software I've rewritten this repo based on that.
This HTML-based code is just left around for me to steal bits from now and
then.  At this point it could get ax'd without causing any inconvenience,
but it isn't in the way in this directory either.
